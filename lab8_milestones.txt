Grading Rubric (Updated 3/18/15)
TOTAL POINTS: 40

2 points:
1. Set up a GitHub repository so all three group members can individually make edits 
and push those changes to the master. (All; David(master branch))

10 points:
2. Spend upwards of 5 hours each researching SDL and going through tutorials on 
LazyFoo. (All)

8 points:
3. Begin to allocate images for our towers (cannons, archer towers, freeze towers) and 
for the background. We can start by getting the program to compile and bring up a 
window with a few test images. (David:Towers, Jack:Towers/Enemies, Luke: Background image, Enemies)

10 points:
4. Create initial classes and insert a couple methods and private data fields for each 
class. For example, we will make an abstract "Tower" class and a few derived classes 
that consist of Archer Tower ("is a" Tower) or Cannon Tower ("is a" Tower). We will also 
begin to develop classes for the "Enemy" abstract base class, with derived classes for 
particular types. Ultimately we are trying to plan out exactly how these classes will 
function. (David: 2 or 3 Derived Classes from Tower Class, Jack:Tower Class + 1 derived class AND Enemy Class + 1 Derived class, Luke: 2 or 3 Derived classes from Enemy Class)

10 points:
5. Use SDL2 to practice animation by moving an image across the screen, even if it doesn't follow the path on the background image (All)

Specific sub tasks to be completed by each member and submitted to GitHub:
Luke Garrison: Submit a black screen with path outlined on it and maybe a dot moving inside.
David Lewis: Submit a picture of an Enemy on a black screen inside path programmed by Luke
Jack Ryan: Design Tower Base class and a few derived classes (interface only)

Team Members: Jack Ryan, David Lewis, Luke Garrison
